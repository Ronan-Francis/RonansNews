Welcome to my News App! This application provides a convenient way for users to access and read news stories from various sources. The app utilizes the NewAPI.org API to fetch news articles and presents them to 
the user in an organized and user-friendly manner. Additionally, users can search their news feed by using the search tab. Furthermore, users can create an account
with a unique username and password to personalize their experience and save their liked stories.

### Editor's note
As of today, 12/05/2023 at 7:30 am, I had dedicated a total of 5 hours to this version of the project. Regrettably, during the final stages of completing the project, I experienced a significant setback due to data loss as I mistakenly used the "git pull" command instead of "git push," and not realising what I was doing I lost 57,154 project files. I attempted to recover the lost files using the Github Desktop App however I was unable to retreive the files without my computer crashing.

However, I was able to reconstruct the project from memory and my remaing available resources. This has left some of the code less to be desired to say the least their are a lot of bugs but I hope to continue working on this project going forward.
